Start by initializing the repository:

git init Morning_sting.git

cd Morning_sting.git

git pull "url from github"

Now you should have everything from the master file online.

You need to add the repository url as your remote default:

git remote add origin "url from github"

You can check it with:

github remote -v

You may also need to verify your identity:

git config --global user.name "your.username"

To add a file, make sure it's in the github repository folder, then:

git add "filename"

git commit -m "Some message"

git push origin master

Then it should be online!
